## üîç Prompt Lint

Our star tool is the Prompt Lint - your friendly neighborhood prompt checker! It helps ensure your prompts are in tip-top shape before you share them on the Novelcrafter Discord.

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Usage

It's as easy as pie! Just run:

```bash
uv run prompt_lint your_prompt_file.json
```

To apply fixes, run:

```bash
uv run prompt_lint --fix your_prompt_file.json
```

The tool works on the extracted JSON version of the prompt:

To convert from JSON to gzip+base64 (suitable for pasting into Novelcrafter), run:  `jq -Mc . <prompt.json | gzip | base64 >prompt.b64`

And from gzip+base64 (as copied from Novelcrafter) to JSON: `base64 -d <prompt.b64 | gunzip | jq . >prompt.json`

### Features

- ‚ú® Validates prompt syntax
- üí° Attempts naive fixes of missing parenthesis
- üöÄ Works right from your command line
